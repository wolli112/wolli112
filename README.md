### Hello,

my nickname is wolli112, I am very interested in all areas of IT and microelectronics. I was drawn to the Python programming language years ago, but now I program my microcomputers exclusively with Micropython.
I like Python because it runs on all operating systems without much effort.

I hope to inspire you with my ideas and would also be happy to receive feedback.

P.S.
My scripts and instructions are usually in German, but if I have a lot of time I also translate them into English.
